# Aquamonitor project for 2025 Deep Learning course

This repository hosts our work on the Aquamonitor project for the classification of Benthic macroinvertebrates from Finnish lakes.

We used several deep learning architectures to address the task, including:

- [model with new weights]()
- [Fine-tuned ResNet18](https://github.com/RiboRings/AI_take_over/blob/main/aquaresnet.ipynb)
- [Fine-tuned Swin](https://github.com/RiboRings/AI_take_over/blob/main/aquaswin.ipynb)
